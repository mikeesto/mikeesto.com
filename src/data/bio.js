I work at QUT within the human-computer interaction (HCI) discipline where I develop projects with React, Node and microcontrollers. I love teaching others how to code. Since 2016 I’ve regularly taught high school and university students web development. I’m also a tragic sports fan.

This page is a collation of side projects, blog posts and papers that I have created or collaborated on.`
