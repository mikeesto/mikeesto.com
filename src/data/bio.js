I work at the Queensland University of Technology within the human-computer interaction (HCI) discipline. I spend my day-to-day developing projects with React, Node and microcontrollers. Since 2016 I’ve regularly taught programming to primary, high school and university students.

I have a Bachelor of Computer Science / Bachelor of Laws.

This page is a collation of side projects, blog posts and papers that I have created or collaborated on.
