      About me
    </h1>

    <p>
      I'm Michael Esteban. A software engineer from Brisbane, Australia. I
      create small, purpose-driven websites and interactive tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently work at the University of Queensland where I am helping build
      the <a
        class="underline decoration-dotted"
        href="https://internetobservatory.org.au/"
        >Australian Internet Observatory</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Previously, I spent seven years in the Human Computer Interaction lab at
      the Queensland University of Technology. I was a wearer of many hats and
      my days were a mix of coding, soldering, 3D printing, teaching and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of my work involves finding ways to make complex interactions more
      accessible and engaging through visualisation and user-friendly
      interfaces. This tends to lend itself to the JavaScript/TypeScript world,
      although I'm very pragmatic and will use whatever tool is best for the
      job.
    </p>

    <p>
      With degrees in Computer Science and Law, I enjoy bridging the technical
      and human aspects of technology. I love teaching others how to program and
      regularly lead primary, high school, and university classes. When I'm not
      online, you can usually find me on a tennis court.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website is primarily a collation of side projects, blog posts and
      papers that I have created or collaborated on.
