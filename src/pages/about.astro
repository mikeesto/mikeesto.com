          <p>
            I'm Michael Esteban. A software engineer from Brisbane, Australia. I
            create purpose-driven websites and interactive tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            I currently work at the University of Queensland in the <a

              Research Centre for Digital Cultures and Societies</a
            >, where I am helping build the

              >Australian Internet Observatory</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            Previously, I spent seven years at the Queensland University of
            Technology in the Human Computer Interaction lab and the School of
            Computer Science. I was a wearer of many hats and my days were a mix
            of programming, teaching, prototyping, soldering, 3D printing and
            more.
          </p>

          <p>
            Much of my daily work involves building end-to-end systems to
            support interdisciplinary research projects. I find real joy in web
            development, and I'm equally excited by designing and deploying
            cloud architectures. My current personal passion lies in exploring
            multimodal large language models capable of processing and
            understanding diverse data types beyond just text.
          </p>

          <p>
            With degrees in Computer Science and Law, I enjoy bridging the
            technical and human aspects of technology. I love teaching others
            how to program and regularly lead primary, high school, and
            university classes. When I'm not online, you can usually find me on
            a tennis court.
          </p>

          <p>
            This website is primarily a collation of side projects, blog posts
            and papers that I have created or collaborated on.
