      About me
    </h1>

    <p>
      I'm Michael Esteban. A software engineer from Brisbane, Australia. I
      create small, purpose-driven websites and interactive tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      I currently work in the Human Computer Interaction lab at the Queensland
      University of Technology. I'm a wearer of many hats and my days are a mix
      of coding, soldering, 3D printing, teaching and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      A big focus of my work is finding ways to make complex interactions more
      accessible and engaging through visualisation and user-friendly
      interfaces. This tends to lend itself to the JavaScript/TypeScript world,
      although I'm very pragmatic and will use whatever tool is best for the
      job. Some of the projects that I work on also have a hardware component
      where I put on my maker hat and write code that runs on Raspberry Pis
      housed in laser-cut or 3D-printed enclosures.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recently, I've been exploring how people interact with LLMs. I'm curious
      if there are more intuitive and effective ways to use LLMs beyond a
      chatbox interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      With degrees in Computer Science and Law, I enjoy bridging the technical
      and human aspects of technology. I love teaching others how to program and
      regularly lead primary, high school, and university classes. When I'm not
      online, you can usually find me on a tennis court.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website is primarily a collation of side projects, blog posts and
      papers that I have created or collaborated on.
